    - Walking, Walking, Walking, Walking and So Forth: >

        The evening grew dark around the pair of foxes.  They had wound their way through
        alleys packed with singing possums, and streets where giraffes in rumpled sportscoats
        bumped past them with their briefcases.  They kept walking.  


        And now the stores rolled shut their corrugated metal lids.  
        Crickets crawled out from the gutters and nudged at the loose change.

        "Anyway, you must admit he's a terrible President," said Fox Small. _"Why_ does President Marcos have a rabbit as Vice President of
        the Foxes."


        "The Vice President?  The rabbit with the _eyebrows_?"


        "No, the rabbit with the *huge sausage lips*," said Fox Small.


        But their conversation was abruptly interupted by a freckly cat head which popped from the sky just above the sidewalk.

        What is this about?!

        Oh, come on.  This is rich.  More meta.


        I'm not going to bother illustrating this discussion Blixy had with the foxes at this point!
        It's all a *bunch of _conjecture_*.  _HOW_ can they presume to know the landscape of my family drama?
        I love my sister.  For a long time, I _worshipped_ her. (This is my sister Quil.)


        I admit that there was a pretty painful day a few months ago and I kind of freaked out.  I was
        laid out on the long patio chair by the pool in my mom's backyard.  I had a Dr. Pepper and a bit
        of german chocolate cake.  I was eating with a kid fork.  Everything else was in the dishwasher,
        that's all they had.  Three prongs.


        My mom started talking about Quil.  All about how much money she was blowing on pants and purses.
        A five-hundred dollar purse.  And then she said, "She's losing it.
        She sounded totally high on the phone." (She nailed it on the head, Quil was smoking dope and
        loving it.)


        So I'd been noticing how observant my mom could be.  That's why, when she said, "I actually think she's on
        cocaine," I _physically_ stood up and chucked my soda across the yard.


        It sailed off into the woods somewhere.  We had been talking awhile, so it was dark when the can flew.
        I paced a bit.  And then I screamed at the top of my lungs.


        My uncle Mike was standing there with the glass door open, staring at me.  He said something totally
        nervous like, "Oh, okay.  Well, I'll--"  And the tea in his glass was swishing back and forth, sloshing
        all over.  He disappeared.  He's not very good at saying things to people.  He's more of a whistler.  And resonant.

        So, to be completely honest, yes, I got a little mad.  I got mad.  You know.  I dealt with it.
        Quil calls me regularly.  For some stupid reason, I rarely call her.


        Plus, she didn't end up killing herself.  So it's just not an issue.  Who knows if it was real.
        She just had a lot of vodka.  And she's little.  So it was just scary to see Quil guzzling it down like that.
        I mean forcing it down.
 

        But why talk about it?  It'll just make her feel like I'm disappointed.  Or like I'm a jerk.


        Well, I got off track there a bit.  Where was I?  Blix is basically helping the foxes around, getting them on
        the trail of their truck.  Yeah, back to all that.

        "We can't squeeze on to this bus," said the smallest fox.


        "Guys, walk on up," said Blix.  "What's the hold up?  Oh, the frogs.  Yeah, just squeeze through."
        Blixy pushed from behind.


        "Hey," said the Tall Fox.  "I'm crammed on this little step!  Somebody move!"


        "Did you get through-- young fox??" said the cat.


        "No," said Fox Small, "can't you see?  The driver keeps shaking his head and it's _really_
        making me nervous.  I don't think he wants us on."


        "Go," said Blix.  He stepped down from his step and walked around the bus, peering through
        the plexiglass windows.  "Well, I don't know, guys.  I dunno.  I guess it's got a lot of frogs."  He pounded
        on the window.  "Hey!  Move over!"
