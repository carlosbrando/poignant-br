      Caring For You.  And Your Wellness.: >

        I need you to be in a good mental state for the latter half of this book.
        Now is the time to begin conditioning you.


        Let's start with some deep breathing.  Give me a good deep breath and
        count to four with me.  


        Here we go.  1.  2.  3.  4.   Now exhale.  You
        can feel your eyes.  Good, that's exactly it.


        Now let's take a deep breath and, in your mind, draw a hippopotamus
        as fast as you can.  Quick quick.  His legs, his folds, his
        marshmallow teeth.  Okay, done.  Now exhale.


        Take another deep breath and hold it tight.  As you hold it tightly in
        your chest, imagine the tightness is shrinking you down into a bug.
        You've held your breath so hard that you're an insect.  And all the
        other bugs saw you shrink and they loved the stunt.  They're clapping
        and rubbing their feelers together madly.   But you had an apple in
        your hand when you were big and it just caught up with you, crushed
        the whole crowd.  You're dead, too.  Now exhale.


        Give me a solid deep breath and imagine you live in a town where
        everything is made of telephone cords.  The houses are all telephone
        cords, the shingles, the rafters.  The doorways are a thick mass of
        telephone cords which you simply thrust yourself through.  When you
        go to bed, the bedspread is telephone cords.  And the mattress and
        box springs are telephone cords, too.  Like I said, everything is made
        out of telephone cords.  The telephone itself is made of telephone
        cords.  But the telephone cord going to the telephone is made out of
        bread and a couple sticks.  Now exhale.


        Breathe in.  1.  2.  3.  4.  Breathe out.


        Breath in.  1.  2.  Another short breath in.  3.  4.  Imagine both
        of your hands snapping off at the wrists and flying into your computer
        screen and programming it from the inside.  Exhale.


        Big, big deep breath.  Deep down inside you there is a submarine.
        It has a tongue.  Exhale.


        Breathe through your nostrils.  Deep breath.  Filter the air through
        your nostrils.  Breathing through the nostrils gives you quality air.
        Your nostrils flare, you are taking breaths of nature's air, the way
        God intended.  Imagine a floppy disk drive clogged up with orphans.
        And while it chokes on orphans, you have good, wholesome God's 
        breath in your lungs.  But that pleasurable, life-giving air will
        become a powerful toxin if held too long.  _Hurry, exhale God and
        nature's air!_


        Now, you will wake up, smoothing out the creases of this page in
        your web browser.  You will have full recollection of your
        whole life and not forgetting any one of the many 
        adventures you have had in your life.  You
        will feel rich and renewed and expert.  You will have no remembrance
        of this short exercise, you will instead remember teaching a rabbit
        to use scissors from a great distance.


        And as you will wake up with your eyes directed to the top of this
        exercise, you will begin again.  But this time, try to imagine that
        even _your shadow_ is a telephone cord.
