        bus is so crowded that most white collar animals get frogs to hold their seat through the nighttime.
        For whatever reason, it works.  It's become this staple of their workflow and their economy.


        If you can muster up a bit of imagination, you can see a *percent sign* as a frog's slanted face.
        Got the picture in your head?  Now let me show you frogs that camp out inside strings.


        <pre>
         # The %s format is for placing full strings.
         irb> "Seats are taken by %s and %s." % ['a frog', 'a frog with teeth']
           => "Seats are taken by a frog and a frog with teeth."

         # The %d format is for placing numbers, while the %f format is for
         # floats (decimal numbers).
         irb> frogs = [44, 162.30]
         irb> stats = "Frogs have filled %d seats and paid %f blue crystals."
         irb> stats % frogs
           => "Frogs have filled 44 seats and paid 162.30 blue crystals."

         # Formatting is flexible with types, you can pass in strings
         # and format them like numbers.
         irb> frogs = ['44', '162.30']
         irb> stats % frogs
           => "Frogs have filled 44 seats and paid 162.30 blue crystals."
        </pre>


        What you are seeing above uses the @%@ method in the @String@ class.
        This method takes *a string* and *an array* and slurps them in together
        to create a new string.  The items from the list are yanked out (in order) and
        placed in their saved seats.  It's the open of the business
        day and the frogs have done their job.


        <pre>
         # See, here's the String#% method called like other methods.
         irb> "Please move over, %s.".%( 'toothless frog' )
           => "Please move over, toothless frog"

         # Now let's call it the prettier way, with the percent sign
         # right between the string and the array.
         irb> "Here is your 1098 statement for the year, %s." % ['teeth frog']
           => "Here is your 1098 statement for the year, teeth frog."
        </pre>


        This is also available as the @Kernel::format@ method or @Kernel::sprintf@
        method.  (In the C language, there is a @sprintf@ method which operates
        just like this.)


        <pre>
         irb> format "Frogs are piled %d deep and travel at %d mph.", [5, 56]
           => "Frogs are piled 5 deep and travel at 56 mph."
        </pre>


        For the most part, you'll only need @%s@ (strings), @%d@ (integer numbers)
        or @%f@ (float numbers) format specifiers.  The @%p@ placeholder will
        run @inspect@ on an object.


        Yeah, so, frog formatting is really handy for building strings that are
        assembled from different kinds of data.  You can learn all the various
        kinds of format specifiers by reading the @ri sprintf@ page.  I'm just
        going to give you a few quick pointers.


        Let's say you have the array but you want the items to appear in
        *a different order* in the string.  In such a situation, you can identify
        specific items by placing a number (@1$@ for the first item, @2$@ for the second,
        and so on) right after the percent sign.


        <pre>
         irb> "This bus has %1$d more stops before %2$d o'clock.  That's %1$d more stops." % [16, 8]
           => "This bus has 16 more stops before 8 o'clock.  That's 16 more stops."
        </pre>


        The second tip I have for you is that you can allot a certain number of characters for
        each item, a width.  And if an item is smaller than the width, extra spaces
        will be used before the item.  To pad it.
        If the width is a negative number, the item will be forced to left and the
        padding will come after it.


        <pre>
         # Give one item 30 characters of width
         irb> "In the back of the bus: %30s." % ['frogs']
           => "In the back of the bus:                          frogs."

         # Give one left-justified item 30 characters of width
         irb> "At the front of the bus: %-30s." % ['frogs']
           => "At the front of the bus: frogs                         ."
        </pre>


        Fox Small kept looking up at the bus driver.  Remember, he wouldn't enter the bus!


        "What's the deal?" said Fox Tall.  "Can't you just get on and we'll just stand in the aisle?"


        "You really want to get on this bus?  That driver has no hands," said Fox Small, speaking close
        and hushed to Fox Tall, "and all he has, instead of hands, are sucker cups."
