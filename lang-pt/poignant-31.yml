        You finish reading the above comic and retire to your daybed for reflection. It's one of
        those canopy affairs which is always logjammed with pillows.  You sit atop the pile,
        gazing out upon the world.  You see the tall smokestacks belching wide spools of fume and
        haze.  The tangled concourses of freeways smattered with swift, shimmering traffic is but
        a gently pulsing eye muscle from your vantage point.


        It is all so fantastic.  How the colors of the horizon spread across the landscape as a great
        mix of butter and grease with a tablespoon of vanilla extract.


        Yet, for all of the beauty which beckons for your attention, the images of the Elf and 
        his Olympic Hopeful return.  And more especially, that order for *55,000* starmonkeys.  
        _55,000 starmonkeys_, you think.  _Fifty-five Thousand_.


        You think of just the number itself.  _55,000_.  It's walking down a road.  It might be in
        a forest, you don't know for sure as your eyes are fixed right on the number itself.  It's stopping
        and talking to people.  To tennis players, to a men's choral group.  There is merriment and good 
        feeling.  When it laughs, its lower zeros quiver with glee.


        You want to talk to it.  You want to skip along that forest trail with it.  You want to climb
        aboard a jet bound to Brazil with it.  And after five days and four nights at the leisureful
        Costa do Sauipe Marriott Resort & Spa, to marry it, to bear a family of 55,000 starmonkeys with it.
        To take possession of Nigeria with it.


        With a flying leap, you dismount your pillow tower of isolation.  Scrambling with the key,
        you unlock your roll top desk and pull out a sheet of paper, holding it firmly upon the
        desk.  You begin scribbling.


        bq. _Take possession of Nigeria with my new 55,000 starmonkeys_... 

        _Over it, build Nigeria-sized *vegetarians only* casino and go-cart arena_...

        _Wings... we could have our own special sauce on the wings that's different_...

        _Mustard + codeine = Smotchkkiss' Starry Starmonkey Glow Sauce_...

        _Franchise, franchise... logos_... 

        _Employee instructional videos_... 

        _When you give the customer change,
        let them reach inside the frog on your hand to get it_...  

        _If they have no change, at least put their
        reciept some place where they have to touch the frog_...  

        _We're leveling the playing field here_...

        _Advertise cheap pizza, let's make our money off soda_...

        _Collect all 4 frosted glasses_...


        Wow, the ideas are really coming out.  You literally had to smack yourself to stop.  We need to put these
        in a safe place.  Actually, we should store them on your computer and mangle the words.  You look out the
        window and watch for FBI.  I'm going to start this script.

 
        h3. The Flipping Script


        <pre>
         print "Type and be diabolical: "
         idea_backwards = gets.reverse
        </pre>


        Let this script be your confidante.  It will ask for evil plans and turn their letters backwards.
        The @gets@ method is *built into Ruby*.  It's a *kernel method* like @print@.  This method @gets@
        will pause Ruby to let you type.  When you hit _Enter_, @gets@ will then stop paying attention
        to your keyboard punchings and answer back to Ruby with a string that contains everything you typed.
